The word 'pandemic' was relatively new for me. I can't remember where I heard it the first time, probably from the internet. There is also a chance that I have come across the word for the first time while reading the intro of the book **Tipping Point** by _Malcolm Gladwell_. But that's the topic of another blog.

Okay, no more pandemic talking. Let's talk about the virus first. I am not sure if I got the virus...

_will continue_...
