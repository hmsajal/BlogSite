This is my first blog written from _netlify cms_ . I am a bit excited about it. Because if you are a tech guy and if you knew me two years ago you only could see a young unemployed boy graduated in some tech discipline has rarely any skill to sell. But what I can do now is not bad. This stack I have used to build this blog is called Jamstack. It's a new and growing web tech. I hope I can learn more everyday and become a better developer.
